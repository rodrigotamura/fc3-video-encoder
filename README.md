# Overview
This project converts (packaging) MP4 videos to MPEG Dash (using Bento4) and store it in a cloud bucket object storage.

# Requirements
### Bento 4
Bento4 is a C++ class library and tools designed to read and write ISO-MP4 files. This format is defined in international specifications ISO/IEC 14496-12, 14496-14 and 14496-15. The format is a derivative of the Apple Quicktime file format, so Bento4 can be used to read and write most Quicktime files as well. In addition to supporting ISO-MP4, Bento4 includes support for parsing and multiplexing H.264 and H.265 elementary streams, converting ISO-MP4 to MPEG2-TS, packaging HLS and MPEG-DASH, CMAF, content encryption, decryption, and much more.

Upload to GCP and send message to RabbitMQ

### Service account

In order to download and upload the video files we need to create a service account at GCP

### Dependencies
* `github.com/asaskevich/govalidator` for data validation
* `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` for testing
* `github.com/satori/go.uuid` for uuid management
* `github.com/jinzhu/gorm` for database connection

# Domain Layer
Video is an entity of this project.

Job are steps which competes to convert the videos into another codec. Job should have:
* id
* local to store

We'll have `service` folder which is responsible to set the usecases.

# Application Layer
It communicates with domain layer in order to executes transitions (ex: coonection with DB).

Let`s work with Repository pattern, buildibng an interface which commuunicates with domain layer and a connection to our database, using GoORM.

In `development` we`ll use SQLite.

In `production` we`ll use Postgres.

GoORM will be configured at the **framework layer**.

## Repositories

Every repository is based on interfaces and interfaces only shows us each method we need to implement.

# Framework layer
In this layer we`ll configure every external adapters, e.g. DB.
